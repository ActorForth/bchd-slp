## Use cases for old auction

re: https://github.com/ActorForth/Auction-Protocol/blob/main/proposal-spec.md

1. For a given SLP token (type 129 = V1_NFT1_GROUP), list each child NFTs, along with metadata.
2. List current owner of a child NFT
3. For a given SLP token, list its transaction history (doesn't appear to be needed, but maybe useful for UX)
